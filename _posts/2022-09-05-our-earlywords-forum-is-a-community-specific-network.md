title: Our EarlyWords Forum is a community specific network!
---
EarlyWords has used Twitter as our community connecting space. Twitter is an online news and social networking site where people communicate in short messages called tweets. Tweeting is posting short messages. Another description of Twitter and tweeting might be microblogging.  We have become concerned about the safety of conducting on that site so we built an option just for us. 

Community specific social networks have gained popularity in recent years as more and more people are looking for online spaces where they can connect with others who share their interests and hobbies. These networks provide a sense of belonging and connection that can be difficult to find on larger, more generalized social media platforms.

One of the main benefits of community specific social networks is that they allow users to connect with like-minded individuals who have similar interests. This can be especially beneficial for people who are passionate about a particular topic or activity, as they can find others who share their enthusiasm and can provide support, advice, and encouragement.

Another advantage of community specific social networks is that they can provide a more supportive and inclusive environment compared to larger, more generalized platforms. Because these networks are focused on a specific topic or group, they often have a more positive and welcoming atmosphere, which can be especially beneficial for people who may be marginalized or excluded on social media platforms.

In addition to providing a sense of connection and support, community specific social networks can also be a great place for users to share their knowledge and expertise. Whether it's advice on a particular hobby or topic, or tips and tricks for beginners, these networks can be a valuable resource for people looking to learn more about a particular subject.

Community specific social networks are great to invest in because they provide a sense of connection, support, and belonging for users, and can be a valuable resource for sharing knowledge and expertise.  [EarlyWords](https://earlywords.io/) is pleased to provide an internal space for connection and encouragement.
