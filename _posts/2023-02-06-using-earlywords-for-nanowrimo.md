title: Using EarlyWords for NaNoWriMo?!
---

Nanowrimo, short for National Novel Writing Month, is a yearly event that takes place during the month of November. The goal of Nanowrimo is for participants to write a 50,000-word novel in just 30 days. This challenge is open to anyone who wants to participate, and it has become increasingly popular in recent years.  Participating in Nanowrimo can be a rewarding and challenging experience. Many participants find that the process of writing a novel in such a short amount of time is exhilarating and rewarding. It can also be a great way to meet other writers and make new friends.

One of the biggest challenges of Nanowrimo is finding the time and motivation to write every day. This can be difficult for many people, especially if they have busy schedules. However, there are many resources available to help participants stay on track. The Nanowrimo website offers a variety of tools and support to help writers stay motivated and on track. These include writing prompts, virtual writing sessions, and forums where participants can connect with each other.

Another challenge of Nanowrimo is the pressure to write a certain number of words each day. This can be overwhelming for some writers, especially if they are new to the process. However, it is important to remember that the goal of Nanowrimo is not to write a perfect novel, but to simply get words on the page. Participants should not worry too much about spelling, grammar, or other details at this stage. The focus should be on getting the story down on paper and moving forward.

We used the [EarlyWords](https://earlywords.io/) page for our novel writing session. The consistent encouraging prompts that flashed at the top of the page were inspiring. The simple layout kept us focused. We loved the word count function the most.  750 words felt like a goal we could all accomplish and felt good to always get to.  Then weâ€™d keep typing and reach the Nanowrimo goal. 

Overall, participating in Nanowrimo can be a rewarding and challenging experience. It requires dedication and hard work, but the sense of accomplishment that comes from writing a novel in just 30 days can be truly rewarding. Whether you are a seasoned writer or a beginner, Nanowrimo is a great opportunity to challenge yourself and take your writing to the next level. We recommend [EarlyWords](https://earlywords.io/) as fun tool if you decide to try this challenge!
